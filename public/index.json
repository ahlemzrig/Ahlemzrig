However, my favorite courses have involved teaching R to students - many of whom had never heard of R before. The first time I taught R was to a group of extremely motivated high school students during an intensive summer school program called SciX (Science Extension Program) in January 2021. You can check out my blog on SciX for more details here. \n A few months later I had the opportunity to be a tutor/Teaching Assistant for a ‚ÄúPsychology Research Internship‚Äù course for university students. In the course, students learned all about open science and reproducibility. In fact, students had the daunting task to try to reproduce plots in R from open source, published papers. Every week I ran 1 session that was dedicated to teaching the students new features, packages, and functions in R and 1 session that was dedicated to answering any questions the students had or troubleshoot error messages. In just 10 weeks, students went from not knowing a single thing about R to creating beautiful visualisations and submitting their final reports in Rmarkdown. Their final reports included all of their code and progress from along the way and it was absolutely amazing to see! It was definitely one of the most rewarding experiences for me as a teacher. \n After teaching these courses, I‚Äôm keen to share everything I learned about teaching R as I‚Äôm sure there are many people out there who have heard about R or want to learn, but have no idea where to start. If this is you, I hope you find this blog helpful! \n In this blog I‚Äôll cover what I believe to be the most essential things in order to get started on your coding journey. Of course I won‚Äôt be able to go into too much detail on any one topic, but I‚Äôll provide incredibly useful resources üìö along the way. \n\rInstalling R and RStudio\r\r\rR is a free, open source programming language that is often used for statistical and data analyses and visualizations\n\rRStudio is an IDE (integrated development environment) for R\n\rYou will need to install/download both R and RStudio\n\rYou can install R from the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) website. I suggest downloading the latest version, which (as of the time of writing this blog) is R 4.1.1\n\rR for Windows link\rR for Mac link\r\rYou can download RStudio here\n\rAlthough you need to have R installed, you will mostly likely never need to open R because you can do everything you need in RStudio\n\r\r\rGetting familiar with RStudio\rThere are 4 panes you will quickly become very familiar with within RStudio\nTop Left: This is the Source Editor where you write scripts\r\rTo test it out, you can go File ‚Üí New File ‚Üí R Script\r\rBottom Left: This is the Console where you can type code that you want to run one time and don‚Äôt want to save it to a script. If you run a line of code in a script, depending on your settings, you may see the output in your console\rTop Right: There are quite a few tabs here, but the most important tab for beginners is the Environment tab where you can see all of your saved variables and objects\rBottom Right: There are also several tabs here, but here you can see:\r\rFiles that are located within your working directory\rYour beautiful plots and visualizations\rPackages that you already have or would like to install\rHelp documentation. This is a really great built in feature to help you understand specific functions. To test this out type ?mean into the console and you will see the documentation for the mean() function. This is incredibly useful to see what the function looks like, including what arguments it takes, and often there will be examples at the bottom of the documentation with code for you to test out the function.\r\r\r üìö Recommended resource: R-Ladies Sydney RYouWithMe BasicBasics Tutorial \n Tip: Want to work in dark mode or change your color theme? Navigate to: Tools ‚Üí Global Options ‚Üí Appearance and test out different color themes (I use ‚ÄúTomorrow Night Bright‚Äù) \n\rWorking Directory\rBefore getting started with some coding, it‚Äôs important to understand what a working directory is.\n\rWhat is a working directory? A working directory (wd) is the location where R will look for files. This is where R believes you are located.\n\rHow do you know what your wd is? In the console type getwd() to see what‚Äôs called your ‚Äúcurrent working directory‚Äù. You may notice that this path will most likely align with the path at the top of the Files tab because, again, this is where R thinks you are located. If you want load in any files, you must be in the correct working directory or R will return an error saying cannot open file x: No such file or directory\rHow do you set your wd? There are a few ways you can do this‚Ä¶\r\rOption 1 (not recommended): Session ‚Üí Set Working Directory ‚Üí Choose Directory and navigate to find the correct folder\rOption 2 (also not recommended): setwd() to manually enter the path you want\rOption 3 (highly recommended!): Create an R Project that will automatically set your wd to where your project is saved\r\r\r\rR Projects\r\rWhat is an R Project? An R project is just a way to keep all of your files associated with any given project together, organized, and easily accessible. If you wish to test out how to set up an R Project, following along with the next few steps. Take a look in the top right hand corner of RStudio and you will see a blue R cube. Assuming you haven‚Äôt already created a project, it will say ‚ÄúProject: (None)‚Äù. To create a new project, click on that and select New Project. You will see the following options:\r\rThis is where you decide where you want your project to be located. If you already have an existing folder choose ‚ÄúExisting Directory‚Äù and navigate to the correct folder and create your project. If you want to create a new folder choose the ‚ÄúNew Directory‚Äù and New Project. Here you will have to create a name for your directory and again select where you want your project to be located and then Create Project. We won‚Äôt worry about the version control option for now, but you may find it super handy, especially if you use GitHub.\nOnce you‚Äôve created your project, I suggest closing out of RStudio and navigating to your files where you just saved your project. You should see the familiar looking R cube with your directory name. Now all you have to do to open your project is double click on this R cube. RStudio will automatically open and you can type getwd() in the console to confirm you‚Äôre in the correct location and you files will be in the Files tab. If you followed along with these steps, congrats on setting up your first R project! üòÑ\n\rR Scripts\rNow that we‚Äôve covered some of the basics, let‚Äôs write our first R script!\nTo start, click File ‚Üí New File ‚Üí R Script. Let‚Äôs first save our script by clicking on the save icon or ctrl/cmd + S. As I‚Äôm not very creative‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll call my script ‚Äúr_script‚Äù.\n One important note here: it‚Äôs best practice to avoid using spaces when naming scripts or folders. If you use spaces, you will most likely run into an error message, so best to avoid white spaces altogether. \nI recommend saving this in the same location as your R Project so it‚Äôs all in the same place and easy to find. If you click on the Files tab, you should see your script is now there! For me, I now have a file called r_script.R - notice it has automatically added the extension .R as it‚Äôs an R Script. You can also see it says R Script in the bottom right corner of your Source Editor.\nGreat, let‚Äôs start coding!\n# type or copy the following code into your script:\rprint(\u0026quot;My first script!!\u0026quot;) 10 + 20 + 30\rx = 1 + 2 + 3\rOkay a few things to go over here:\n\rAnything written after a # is ‚Äúcommented out‚Äù. This means R won‚Äôt read or evaluate anything following a #. This is perfect for leaving comments or notes to yourself like I have done above\rTo run your entire script, click Source and then Source with echo (echo will print out your code along with the output)\r\rYou should see that the first line of code printed ‚ÄúMy first script!!‚Äù\rThe second line of code printed the output ‚Äú60‚Äù\rBut, the last line of code didn‚Äôt print any output. This is because the last line we are defining a variable ‚Äúx‚Äù. So, although nothing is printed in our console output, check out your Environment - you should see you now have your variable ‚Äúx‚Äù saved there and it‚Äôs value is 6!\rBecause you have x saved in your environment, now if you type x in your console, you will see the output\r\rYou can also run your script line by line. One way to do this is put your cursor on the line you want to run and click the green Run button. Or, put your cursor on the line you want to run and press ctr (or cmd) + enter. You‚Äôll see your cursor moves down a line automatically after you run one line. So if you start at the top of your script and press and hold down ctrl and press enter 3 times, all 3 lines of code will run.\r\r\rR Markdown\rWhen I started coding, I only used R scripts. But then I discovered R Markdown and now I use .Rmd scripts exclusively. R Markdown is a great way to create beautiful reports with a mix of text/notes and code. R Markdown files can also be easily converted to html, pdf, or word docs.\nSo, now let‚Äôs create our first Rmarkdown script!\nClick File ‚Üí New File ‚Üí R Markdown.. and enter a title for your script - I‚Äôll title mine ‚ÄúMy Rmarkdown Script‚Äù (note: the title here can have spaces). I‚Äôll stick with the default HTML format, so then can click Okay. Notice now that the bottom right hand corner of the source editor now says R Markdown. Even though we created our file and provided a title, we still have to save our file. I‚Äôll save mine as rmd_script and the .Rmd extension will again be added automatically.\nWhen we created our .R script, we had a blank script, but now we see that we are provided with a default template. There are 4 things I want to quickly point out here, but will go into more detail of each below.\nThe YAML header section: this is located at the top of our markdown file, enclosed by ---\rR chunks: if you want to write code, you have to create an R chunk, which will always have this formatting: ```{r }‚Ä¶```. This is an example of one:\r\rExample R Chunk\n\rAll other space: everything outside of the YAML and R chunks is for writing text. Remember, R Markdown is a meant for integrating content/text along with code. So, everything here will be text written in the markdown language and there‚Äôs no need for the # like we needed in our R script.\n\rYou may have noticed in our .Rmd script (at the top) we have a new Knit button that we didn‚Äôt have in our .R script. Go ahead and press this button to watch R knit your file from R to html (because that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve specified the output to be). Your ‚Äúknitted‚Äù file will either appear in the Viewer pane or in a new window depending on your settings. Here we see we have our title, some text, some code, and even a plot! Pretty cool right?!\n\r\r\rNow, let‚Äôs spend a little more time discussing each of these sections in more detail.\rYAML Section\rIn our default YAML, we already have a title and output specified. There are other arguments you can add here, such as author or date. Let‚Äôs add the author argument to test it out. Try knitting your file again. Now you should see your name appear under the title.\n---\rtitle: \u0026quot;My Rmarkdown Script\u0026quot;\routput: html_document\rauthor: Jenny Sloane ---\r Note: It‚Äôs important to pay attention to spacing here. For example, if I had author:Jenny Sloane without the space I would have issues with knitting my document. \n\rR Chunks\rWe already have a few chunks created for us in our template. In any code chunk, you‚Äôll see a few buttons in the top right corner: an options/gear button and 2 arrows.\r- The gear button allows you to modify chunk options (I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever used this).\r- Next to the gear button, there‚Äôs an arrow pointing down, which if you click it will run all of the chunks above the current chunk.\r- Finally, the green arrow pointing to the right will run all of the code within that current chunk. Of course you can also run your code line by line the same way as we did in the .R scripts (I usually navigate to the chunk I want to work on, press the arrow pointing down, and then run my code line by line by pressing ctrl + enter).\nR chunks have certain options you can set. For example, if you want the actual code to appear in your knitted document, you can set echo=TRUE and if you only want the output to appear and no code you can set echo=FALSE. Other chunk options that I often use are: include, warning, message, and eval.\nThe first chunk you see in the template is a little bit different. While this chunk is not necessary and you can remove it if you‚Äôd like, this is where you can set global chunk options. For example, you can see echo is set to TRUE here, so this means all of the code will appear in your knitted document. You can override the global chunk settings by directly adjusting the options in any specific chunk.\nAs a small aside, you may have noticed next to the r in the example chunk above it says ‚Äúpressure‚Äù. This is where you can set a ‚Äúname‚Äù for you chunk, so it makes sense that this chunk is called pressure as it‚Äôs plotting pressure. This is just another way to help keep your code and report organized.\n Fun (and helpful) fact: in the top right hand corner of the Source Editor there is a button that is a stack of line. I‚Äôve heard this referred to as the pancake button, which I love! If you click on the pancake button, you‚Äôll see an outline for your entire document! To use the outline feature, you simply have to include ‚Äúheaders‚Äù within your document. You can include headers by using # (see image below for examples). \n üìö Recommended resource: Check out the R Markdown ‚ÄúCheat Sheet‚Äù by going to Help ‚Üí Cheat Sheets ‚Üí R Markdown Cheat Sheet.\n üìö Recommended resource: Have a look at other existing cheat sheets here. \n\rMarkdown\rAll text outside of the YAML and R chunks is written with Markdown syntax. You can easily style your text with bold and italics. You can add headers, lists, equations, links, images, and so much more. Below you can see what code looks like in R Markdown compared to what it looks like when it‚Äôs knitted to a pdf.\n üìö Recommended resource: R-Ladies Sydney RYouWithMe MarkyMark Tutorial \n üìö Recommended resource: A great YouTube playlist by Danielle Navarro on R Markdown \n üìö Recommended resource: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ is a great website to learn more about R Markdown. \n\r\rTidyverse!!\r\rI first learned R in base R, but once I learned about tidyverse there was no going back. There‚Äôs so much I can say about tidyverse, but I‚Äôll only cover some of the basics and continue to provide resources along the way.\nWhat is tidyverse?\rTidyverse is a collection of 8 packages (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats) introduced by Hadley Wickham to help with data manipulation, exploration, and visualisation.\r- Check out the tidyverse website to find out more details of each of the individual packages\n\rInstalling tidyverse\rWhenever you want to use a package, the first thing you have to do is install the package. Once you install a package, it will remain installed on your computer, so you only have to install it once (I always install packages in my console as there‚Äôs no need to save it to a script)\n\rThe code to install tidyverse looks like this install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\rThe install.packages() functions will install packages that are part of CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)\r\rInstalling non-CRAN packages\r\rHowever, not all packages are part of CRAN (especially one‚Äôs that are still in development). If you get a warning like the package ‚Äòxxx‚Äô is not available for this version of R, that‚Äôs a good indication that it‚Äôs not on CRAN.\rIf it‚Äôs not on CRAN, you‚Äôll need to locate the repository on GitHub and install via devtools.\r\rFor example, if I wanted to install the package ‚Äúemo‚Äù for emojis üéâ , I would type in something like ‚Äúemo package R‚Äù into Google and search for the GitHub page, which would be https://github.com/hadley/emo. There are instructions for how to install the package in the ReadMe document if you scroll down on the page.\r\r\r üìö Recommended resource: Here‚Äôs a great blog on ‚ÄúR Package Install Troubleshooting‚Äù‚Äù\n\r\rLoading tidyverse\rIt‚Äôs not enough to just install the package. Every time you start a new R session, you need to load in the packages you wish to use, so I always put this code within my script as it needs to run every session.\r- The code to load the package looks like this: library(tidyverse)\r- Whenever you load tidyverse, you will see a message saying it‚Äôs attaching all 8 packages. Therefore, you don‚Äôt have to load in any of the individual packages because they all get called in together. This means as long as you load in tidyverse, you can use functions from any one of the 8 packages.\nSo, you can think about it as having an entire library of all the packages you‚Äôve ever installed. But, in each script and session you need to specify which libraries (aka packages) you want to load in.\n Note: when you install packages you need to use ‚Äù ‚Äù around the package name, but you don‚Äôt need to when you call in the library. \n\rThe Pipe %\u0026gt;%\rThis is the pipe operator: %\u0026gt;%\nIf you use tidyverse, you will quickly become very familiar with this operator. You use the pipe when you want to execute multiple operations in a specific sequence. To me, it makes sense to think about the pipe as ‚ÄúAND THEN‚Äù.\nFor example:\nI want to do x AND THEN\rI want to do y AND THEN\rI want to do z\rwhich is equivalent to:\nI want to do x %\u0026gt;%\rI want to do y %\u0026gt;%\rI want to do z\rFor a real example, let‚Äôs look at some code below. In the code, we‚Äôll first load in tidyverse and the palmerpenguins libraries (you may need to install it if you‚Äôve never used it before). With the palmerpenguins package, there‚Äôs a built in penguins dataset that we‚Äôll explore.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(palmerpenguins) head(penguins) # gives us the first 6 rows of our dataset\r## # A tibble: 6 √ó 8\r## species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_l‚Ä¶¬π body_‚Ä¶¬≤ sex year\r## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\r## 1 Adelie Torgersen 39.1 18.7 181 3750 male 2007\r## 2 Adelie Torgersen 39.5 17.4 186 3800 fema‚Ä¶ 2007\r## 3 Adelie Torgersen 40.3 18 195 3250 fema‚Ä¶ 2007\r## 4 Adelie Torgersen NA NA NA NA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 2007\r## 5 Adelie Torgersen 36.7 19.3 193 3450 fema‚Ä¶ 2007\r## 6 Adelie Torgersen 39.3 20.6 190 3650 male 2007\r## # ‚Ä¶ with abbreviated variable names ¬π‚Äãflipper_length_mm, ¬≤‚Äãbody_mass_g\rlevels(penguins$island)\r## [1] \u0026quot;Biscoe\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Dream\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Torgersen\u0026quot;\rlevels(penguins$species)\r## [1] \u0026quot;Adelie\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Chinstrap\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Gentoo\u0026quot;\rFrom quickly looking at the levels of a couple of variables, we can see there are 3 islands (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen) and 3 species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo).\nI like the idea of a ‚ÄúDream‚Äù island, so the question I‚Äôll ask here is:\n\rWhat is the mean body mass for female and male Adelie penguins on Dream island?‚Äú\r\r\nHere‚Äôs the code to answer my question and below I‚Äôll go through the pipes line by line:\npenguins %\u0026gt;%\rselect(species, island, body_mass_g, sex) %\u0026gt;% # step 1\rfilter(species == \u0026quot;Adelie\u0026quot; \u0026amp; island == \u0026quot;Dream\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% # step 2\rgroup_by(sex) %\u0026gt;% # step 3\rsummarise(mean_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g)) %\u0026gt;% # step 4\rdrop_na() # step 5\r## # A tibble: 2 √ó 2\r## sex mean_body_mass\r## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 female 3344.\r## 2 male 4046.\r\rStep 1: First, from the penguins data, I‚Äôm selecting only the variables I‚Äôm interested in AND THEN‚Ä¶\rStep 2: I‚Äôm filtering my data to only have the Adelie species and only from Dream island AND THEN‚Ä¶\rStep 3: I‚Äôm grouping by sex in order to get an average body mass calculation for males and females AND THEN‚Ä¶\rStep 4: I‚Äôm summarizing my data to get the mean body mass AND THEN‚Ä¶\rStep 5: I‚Äôm dropping the NA values\r\rAnd finally, we see our output: the mean body mass for females Adelie penguins on Dream island is 3344 grams and 4046 grams for males\n Of course, it takes time and practice to learn the different functions within tidyverse. But, these are some of the dplyr functions I use all the time (i.e.¬†select(), filter(), group_by(), summarise(), and drop_na()). \n Tip: To adjust some R Markdown settings go to Tools ‚Üí Global Options ‚Üí R Markdown.

There are many free datasets you can explore within R (e.g.¬†mtcars, iris, penguins from the palmerpenguin package). However, for this blog, I‚Äôve downloaded a dataset from Kaggle on the medal standings from the Tokyo Olympics.\n\rResearch Question: ‚ÄúWhich countries (top 5) won the most medals?‚Äù\r\r\nUsually when I use R, I have a folder within the root of my project titled ‚Äúdata‚Äù and of course this is where I keep the actual data files. This just helps me keep my project more organized and I always know exactly where my data is. So, I‚Äôve done the same thing here - I created a data folder and saved my medals.csv file there. Note, that this is now one folder ‚Äúdeep‚Äù into our project. What this means is that we have to let R know to look inside the ‚Äúdata‚Äù folder in order to find our .csv file because it‚Äôs not located at the root of our project. But don‚Äôt worry, this is easy to do, especially if you know about the here package.\nBelow I‚Äôll show you my typical workflow using the medals dataset.\nLoad in libraries\rlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(janitor) library(here)\rlibrary(ggeasy) # this is an awesome package to help customize ggplots with easy to remember functions\r\rMy first chunk of code is always dedicated to loading in all of the libraries I need for my entire script\rI make sure the chunk options include message=FALSE and warning=FALSE, so when I knit the file I don‚Äôt see all of the messages and warnings from loading in the respective libraries\r\r\rRead in data\rmedals_raw \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;data/medals.csv\u0026quot;)\r# medals_raw \u0026lt;- read_csv(here(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;medals.csv\u0026quot;)) # this will also work, if you wish to use the here package\rhead(medals_raw) # look at only the top 6 rows\r## # A tibble: 6 √ó 7\r## Rank `Team/NOC` Gold Silver Bronze Total `Rank by Total`\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 1 United States of America 39 41 33 113 1\r## 2 2 People\u0026#39;s Republic of China 38 32 18 88 2\r## 3 3 Japan 27 14 17 58 5\r## 4 4 Great Britain 22 21 22 65 4\r## 5 5 ROC 20 28 23 71 3\r## 6 6 Australia 17 7 22 46 6\r\rread_csv() is very similar to read.csv(), except it will automatically read your data in as a tibble (a ‚Äútidy‚Äù dataframe). For this reason, I exclusively use read_csv()\rI could also use the here() function to tell R that I want it to go within the ‚Äúdata‚Äù folder I just created in order to find the ‚Äúmedals.csv‚Äù file\rWe can take a look at the first 6 rows of our raw data using head()\r\r üìö Recommended resource: How to use the here package by Jenny Richmond \n\rClean our data\rmedals_top5 \u0026lt;- medals_raw %\u0026gt;% # create a new variable with our results\rclean_names() %\u0026gt;% # step 1\rselect(team_noc, total) %\u0026gt;% # step 2\rarrange(desc(total)) %\u0026gt;% # step 3\rtop_n(5) # step 4\r\rStep 1: When looking at the data, the first thing I notice is the variable names could be ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù.\r\rWe always want to try to avoid white space, so we‚Äôll want to change our variable ‚ÄúRank by Total‚Äù. Programmers have their own style of coding in order to avoid white space. For example, there‚Äôs ‚Äúsnake_case‚Äù (Rank_by_Total) or ‚Äúcamel case‚Äù (rankByTotal) or ‚Äúkebab case‚Äù (Rank-by-Total).\rMy preference is snake case and I also make sure my variables are all lowercase (mainly because, like most programmers, I‚Äôm lazy and it‚Äôs much easier to type lower case letters than capital letters)\rFortunately, janitor::clean_names() does all of this for me in just one line of code!\rSo, here I‚Äôll use the clean_names() function to remove white space and transform everything to lower case\r\rStep 2: Select only the columns/variables I need in order to answer my research question. This will make your life so much easier, especially if your dataset has dozens or even hundreds of variables\rStep 3: Arrange the total column in descending order\rStep 4: Select only the top 5 rows‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve actually never heard of top_n() before, but I just did a quick Google search and found it!\r\rAnd here we‚Äôre simply printing out our results:\nmedals_top5\r## # A tibble: 5 √ó 2\r## team_noc total\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 United States of America 113\r## 2 People\u0026#39;s Republic of China 88\r## 3 ROC 71\r## 4 Great Britain 65\r## 5 Japan 58\r\rVisualise our results\rFinally, let‚Äôs create a visualisation using ggplot!\r- Notice that we use the + sign rather than the %\u0026gt;% when using ggplot. This may get a little bit confusing at first, but this may be helpful: when using ggplot, think about it as each line is adding a new layer to your plot\nggplot(medals_top5, aes(x = reorder(team_noc, total, sum), y = total, fill=team_noc)) + # I\u0026#39;ve reordered the columns based on the sum of the total variable geom_col() + coord_flip() + # flips the cartesian coordinates to make it easier to read the country names\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Country\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Total Medals\u0026quot;) + # you can also add a \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; here if you\u0026#39;d like\rtheme_bw() + # there are several default themes but I like this one easy_remove_legend() + # one of my favorite functions from ggeasy to remove the legend\reasy_text_size(15) # another one of my favorite functions from ggeasy to change the text size\r\r\rggplot challenge\rI thought it would be fun to end this blog with a bit of a challenge for you to test out all of your new R skills! I‚Äôve included a few hints below, but remember Google is your best friend.\nThanks so much for reading this blog and feel free to share your plots on Twitter and tag me @jfsloane - I‚Äôd love to see!\n Using the medals dataset (which can be found here), are you able to reproduce the graph below?? \n\rI‚Äôve used the 5 countries with the most total medals (the same countries as I plotted in the graph above in the section on ‚ÄúVisualise our results‚Äù)\rThe medal types (gold, silver, bronze) are in a ‚Äúwide‚Äù data format.

Its growth and chemical properties can be modified by agricultural practices especially mineral nutrition and irrigation. An experiment was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of exogenous foliar application of potassium and calcium against the adverse effects of NaCl-induced stress on Thyme. Salt stress decreased growth and photosynthetic assimilation rate. Leaf spray with K+ or Ca2+ reduced salt-induced damage by maintaining K+/Na+ and Ca2+/Na+ ratios, resulting in photosynthesis improvement under salt conditions. Salt-affected plants had higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in their shoot tissues indicating oxidative damage to their cell membranes; Increased K+ and Ca2+ supply reduced the accumulation of both. Salinity appears to have upregulated the activity of antioxidant defense enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, peroxide guaiacol, Monodehydroascorbate reductase, as well as Dehydroascorbate reductase. The application of K+ and Ca2+ solutions onto the foliage of NaCl-affected plants further enhanced the activity of the antioxidant enzymes of the ascorbate glutathione cycle potentially allowing a better protection of the cell membranes from reactive oxygen species..","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Potassium and calcium improve salt tolerance of Thymus vulgaris by activating the antioxidant systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ahlem Zrig","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid\rgraph TD\rA[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round)\rB --\u0026gt; C{Decision}\rC --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1]\rC --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]\r```\r renders as\ngraph TD\rA[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round)\rB --\u0026gt; C{Decision}\rC --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1]\rC --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]\r An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid\rsequenceDiagram\rAlice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you?\rloop Healthcheck\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria\rend\rNote right of John: Rational thoughts!\rJohn--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Alice: Great!\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Bob: How about you?\rBob--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Jolly good!\r```\r renders as\nsequenceDiagram\rAlice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you?\rloop Healthcheck\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria\rend\rNote right of John: Rational thoughts!\rJohn--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Alice: Great!\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Bob: How about you?\rBob--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Jolly good!\r An example Gantt diagram:\n```mermaid\rgantt\rsection Section\rCompleted :done, des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08\rActive :active, des2, 2014-01-07, 3d\rParallel 1 : des3, after des1, 1d\rParallel 2 : des4, after des1, 1d\rParallel 3 : des5, after des3, 1d\rParallel 4 : des6, after des4, 1d\r```\r renders as\ngantt\rsection Section\rCompleted :done, des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08\rActive :active, des2, 2014-01-07, 3d\rParallel 1 : des3, after des1, 1d\rParallel 2 : des4, after des1, 1d\rParallel 3 : des5, after des3, 1d\rParallel 4 : des6, after des4, 1d\r An example class diagram:\n```mermaid\rclassDiagram\rClass01 \u0026lt;|-- AveryLongClass : Cool\r\u0026lt;\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Class01\rClass09 --\u0026gt; C2 : Where am i?\rClass09 --* C3\rClass09 --|\u0026gt; Class07\rClass07 : equals()\rClass07 : Object[] elementData\rClass01 : size()\rClass01 : int chimp\rClass01 : int gorilla\rclass Class10 {\r\u0026lt;\u0026lt;service\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\rint id\rsize()\r}\r```\r renders as\nclassDiagram\rClass01 \u0026lt;|-- AveryLongClass : Cool\r\u0026lt;\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Class01\rClass09 --\u0026gt; C2 : Where am i?\rClass09 --* C3\rClass09 --|\u0026gt; Class07\rClass07 : equals()\rClass07 : Object[] elementData\rClass01 : size()\rClass01 : int chimp\rClass01 : int gorilla\rclass Class10 {\r\u0026lt;\u0026lt;service\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\rint id\rsize()\r}\r An example state diagram:\n```mermaid\rstateDiagram\r[*] --\u0026gt; Still\rStill --\u0026gt; [*]\rStill --\u0026gt; Moving\rMoving --\u0026gt; Still\rMoving --\u0026gt; Crash\rCrash --\u0026gt; [*]\r```\r renders as\nstateDiagram\r[*] --\u0026gt; Still\rStill --\u0026gt; [*]\rStill --\u0026gt; Moving\rMoving --\u0026gt; Still\rMoving --\u0026gt; Crash\rCrash --\u0026gt; [*]\r Todo lists You can even write your todo lists in Academic too:\n- [x] Write math example\r- [x] Write diagram example\r- [ ] Do something else\r renders as\n Write math example Write diagram example Do something else  Tables Represent your data in tables:\n| First Header | Second Header |\r| ------------- | ------------- |\r| Content Cell | Content Cell |\r| Content Cell | Content Cell |\r renders as\n   First Header Second Header     Content Cell Content Cell   Content Cell Content Cell    Callouts Academic supports a shortcode for callouts, also referred to as asides, hints, or alerts.
